# Dino Runner Game
A 2D Chrome Dino inspired infinite runner game made in Godot.

## Overview
The core mechanics of this game was built following a tutorial by [Coding With Russ on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKBhz6oJYsc). I added my own features including:
- **Wardrobe system** that allows you to switch between 4 dinos.
- **Dynamic sprite switching** based on the selected dino.
- **Custom collision layers** to prevent wardrobe features interfering with gameplay.
- **Mouse click interactions** on wardrobe items.
- **Downward acceleration:** press the `down` button to make dino fall faster.
- **Clean code organization:** scripts are placed in separate scripts folder instead of scenes folder.
- **Dynamic cursor visibility changing** for cleaner display when game is running.
