# Dino Runner Game — Enhanced Edition

> A 2D endless runner game built in Godot, originally based on a tutorial, with my own custom features added.

---

## 🎮 Overview

This is a Godot 4 game where you control a dino that runs, jumps, and dodges obstacles. I followed a tutorial to build the core mechanics, then added my own features including:

- ✅ **Wardrobe system** to switch between 4 different dino characters  
- ✅ **Dynamic sprite switching** based on selected dino  
- ✅ **Custom collision layers** to prevent wardrobe objects from interfering with gameplay  
- ✅ **Mouse-click interactions** on wardrobe items  
- ✅ **Downward acceleration** — hold down arrow to fall faster  
- ✅ **Clean code organization** with scripts in separate folder

I learned the core mechanics from this resource and am grateful for the foundation it provided. All original logic and structure from the tutorial remain respected and properly attributed.
